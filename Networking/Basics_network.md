# Basics of Networking

## Hosts
    Hosts are devices which send or recieve traffic.
   ### Types of Hosts
     1. Client --> initiates request
     2. Server --> responds to request

## IP Address
    * IP Address is the identity of each host.
    It is represented by 32 bits(IPv4). Divided as 4 octets ( 8 bits) and converted as decimals. (IPv6) has 128 bits.

    * Your IP address is your networkâ€™s unique address

>  **Eg-  [0-255].[0-255].[0-255].[0-255] / 192.168.1.1**

* ### Static IP
    * #### Benefits:
        One of the main benefits of using static IP addresses is that they are easier to manage and troubleshoot. You can configure your devices with specific settings and preferences, and you do not have to worry about conflicts or errors caused by changing IP addresses. Static IP addresses also enable you to access your devices remotely, host servers or websites, and use certain applications that require a consistent IP address.
    * #### Drawbacks
        prone to attacks. easy to track. need firewall to stop unauthorized access.
